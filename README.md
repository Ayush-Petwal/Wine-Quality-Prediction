# Wine Quality Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## Overview
Wine Quality Prediction is a project aimed at predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model that can classify the quality of wine as high or low.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Wine Quality Data Set] from the Kaggle. It consists of 4898 instances of wine samples with 11 features, including acidity, residual sugar, chlorides, and more.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Petwal/Wine-Quality-Prediction.git
cd Wine-Quality-Prediction
pip install --> streamlit
```
## Run
